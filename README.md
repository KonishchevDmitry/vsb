# VSB

A very simple in configuring, but powerful backup tool which I use to backup my laptop and home server. 

Deduplicates and compresses backed up data, allows to upload encrypted version of backups to cloud storage. Uses only standard file types such as plain text and tar archives for storing backed up files and their metdata, so in the worst case data can be easily restored even without the tool.
